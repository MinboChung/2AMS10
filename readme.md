# <center>Longitudinal Data Analysis (2AMS10)</center>
## Content
### Objectives
- Understand and explain the different complexities that exist within longitudinal data (with respect to the application domain)
- Explain, discuss, criticize, and communicate results from (any) longitudinal data analysis.
- Understand the role and limitations of statistical analysis methods for analyzing longitudinal data (in particular in the health domain)
- Analyze and model longitudinal data with SAS software
- Evaluate goodness-of-fit for the selected statistical model on longitudinal data

### Focus of the course
- Longitudinal data: Data collected over time on a set of units to be able to study changes on these units over time.
- The statistical techniques for analyzing these data where only a limited number of repeated observations on units are being collected.
- Longitudinal data analysis â‰  time series analysis

#### Topic of interests
- Hypothesis testing (e.g. differences b/t groups of units, b/t different time points, and multiple testing)
- Esitmation and confidence intervals (e.g. correlations, variance components, and time changes)
- Statistical modelling (e.g. analysis of variance and mixed effects models)
- Diagnostics and goodness-of-fit (e.g. outlier detection, homogeneity of variances, normality testing, and information criteria)
- SAS software will be used for the data analysis.
